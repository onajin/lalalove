La La Love
=================

La La Love is a fundraising campaign for Epic Change, an organization currently building a school in Tanzania.

Since it's a custom WordPress theme, much of the heavy lifting is taken care by the WordPress blog engine, but there are some custom PHP code chunks used to make the site go.

I built this theme for Epic Change from the ground up because I really believe in their vision and the work that Stacy Monk, Sanjay Patel and Mama Lucy are doing in Tanzania.

In just a few weeks, the La La Love campaign raised over $20k to fund a new secondary school in Tanzania and I'm proud to have helped by building this website.
